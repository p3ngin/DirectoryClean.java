# DirectoryClean.java
Read through a directory and delete all files within a directory without deleting folders

This application will recurssively sift through a directory named in "currentDir" and delete all files.  It will not delete any folders and will leave the directory path unchanged.  

*Be careful of the directory this is run on, as it will delete every file within.
